# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 16, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Working through my FreeCodeCamp and then get some of my web development course done. Tonight I'll look into getting my GitPage sorted out and start designing that tomorrow.

**Thoughts** Feeling really positive about this challange. Looking to add to what im learning in my course while at the same time perfecting my skills. I'm thinking of developing a blog following my story into this totally new field while being a stay at home dad and all the adventures that entails....will think on that for a bit.
