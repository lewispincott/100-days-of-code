# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 2, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've recently begun completing the problems presented on [CodeWars.com](https://www.codewars.com) using JavaScript. It's been awesome for seeing optimal answers and discovering various built-in functionality I had no idea existed. I'm currently working on a problem that's asking me to take an array of strings and an integer **k** and return a concatenated string of the first longest consecutive string composed of the first **k** array elements. Tonight I was able to initialize the repo with a JS and an HTML file and fill in some preliminary functionality, but I still need to do some thinking on the logical innards. [Here's a link to the "kata" on CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56a5d994ac971f1ac500003e/train/javascript).

**Thoughts** I have a general sense of what needs to be done to solve this problem, I'm just trying to come up with the best way to go about it. I'm starting a week-long temporary gig tomorrow along with two job interviews for full-time day jobs, and I got interrupted by the waking of my infant son, so I'll have to return to this tomorrow when I've gotten a little sleep and have a little more downtime. I'll keep it on the back burner. I think I can solve it tomorrow, perhaps with a little googling to chase down the answer.
